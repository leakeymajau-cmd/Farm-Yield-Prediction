Daily Tea Harvest Yield PredictorWelcome to the Daily Tea Harvest Yield Predictor project! This tool helps tea farmers estimate their daily harvest based on a variety of environmental and labor factors. Our goal is to empower farmers with insights that can enhance their productivity and decision-making.Key Features
Data Storage: We use an SQLite database to efficiently manage and store all relevant farm data.
Yield Prediction: The project employs Linear Regression from scikit-learn to predict tea harvest yields based on collected data.
Data Management: Predictions are saved back to the database, allowing for easy tracking and analysis over time.
Real-World Workflow: This project showcases a complete machine learning workflow. We cover everything from data collection to model training, prediction, and storage.
Getting StartedTo get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:
Clone the Repository: Start by copying the repository to your local environment.
git clone [repository-url]
Install Dependencies: Execute the following command to install all necessary libraries:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook: Open yield_prediction.ipynb in VS Code and execute the cells to see the predictions in action.
Feel free to explore and contribute to the project! Your feedback and improvements are always welcome. Together, we can help farmers maximize their yields and refine their practices.
